# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
PostgreSQL

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to us PostgreSQL to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program; as well as identify whether we have enough mentors to mentor in new employees.

## Audit Results
*   The department where we will be losing most of our employees will be in the Senior Engineer department. The count returns 29414 senior engineers will be retiring.

*    Out of six managers in our employee database we have two that are in the retirement range.

*   There are no managers that participate in the mentorship program.

*   The mentorship program does not contain anyone that was born between the retirement filters of 1952-1955.

## Summary

As the employees start retiring thousands of employees, will need to be replaced. The senior engineer department will lose 22919 employees, the senior staff will lose 22919 employes, and the remaining five departments are under 10000 employees. In total 66277 employees will be retiring.

An overview of the count of mentors indicates that there will be enough mentors for new employees as all of their birth dates are from 1965, so they do not contain employees coming up for retirement.
